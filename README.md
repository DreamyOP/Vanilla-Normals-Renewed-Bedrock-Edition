# Vanilla-Normals-Renewed
A shaders compatible minecraft texture pack, based on vanilla but with normals and proper glossiness information.

**⚠️ This version is made for Minecraft bedrock edition 1.17 and above ⚠️**

## Description

I didn't want any of those fancy high-resolution texture packs in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So I decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

This texture pack is free for everyone to use! However if you wish to support me, you can join my Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/Poudingue

## Copyright

You can do whatever you want with my texture pack, screenshots, videos, modifications for personal use or redistribution, as long as you don't sell it and provide a link to this page or my Patreon page. Oh, and also, don't mix it with Realistico. Dead serious. Absolutely not a joke. This is not irony, I really insist. I will sue you. 

## Screenshots

⚠️ The screenshots provided here were made with SEUS renewed, an an old version of minecraft, the results will differ with other shaders ⚠️

Textures have bump mapping information, allowing parallax occlusion mapping and normal mapping.
Smoothness information is very important for the credibility of materials too, especially when the sun lights it at grazing angles.

Metals and smooth materials now have the correct information to compute reflections.
SEUS renewed heavily relies on Screen Space Reflections for this and don't take correctly roughness surfaces for it, so the reflections may be too shiny and imperfect. However using SEUS PTGI will provide Path-Traced reflections and indirect lighting, and correctly take into account roughness.

## Installation

- Install a shader supporting normal and specular mapping. If you don't know which one, give this one a shot
